# Hello There
My name is Janelle C.R. Mendoza and this is my blog for PSYC73800 at The Graduate Center, CUNY. Here I will be cataloging my thoughts and logging my journey throughout this course, as well as be a companion piece to my website/online resume that is currently under construction.

**Note:** Clicking on my name on any blog post will also redirect to my website.
